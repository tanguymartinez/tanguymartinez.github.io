# People

The people page (`/people`) is displayed using a basic page as foundation and view blocks on top thereof. The view reponsible for these blocks is "People" (`people`). It is composed of two displays, which only differ in their respective filter criteria. You can duplicate one and change the filter to adapt to new categories.

To add new people, head to the content section and click "add new". From there, you should be able to add an employee.
